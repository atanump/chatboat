# chatboat
A chatbot that provides a real conversational experience to the user.

In this project we explore a fun and interesting sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie scripts from the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus.

Conversational models are a hot topic in artificial intelligence research. Chatbots can be found in a variety of settings, including customer service applications and online helpdesks. These bots are often powered by retrieval-based models, which output predefined responses to questions of certain forms. In a highly restricted domain like a company's IT helpdesk, these models may be sufficient, however, they are not robust enough for more general use-cases. Teaching a machine to carry out a meaningful conversation with a human in multiple domains is a research question that is far from solved. Recently, the deep learning boom has allowed for powerful generative models like Google's, which marks a large step towards multi-domain generative conversational models. In this tutorial, we will implement this kind of model in PyTorch. .
